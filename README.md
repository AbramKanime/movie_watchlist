## About Movie Watchlist

Movie Watchlist is used to search for movies in the IMDB database by a way of fetching the data from an API call. A keyword can be typed in the search field, and the app returns a list of movies with the keyword contained in them. The user can then save the movies he/she would like to watch. The saved movies are stored in the local storage of the user.

The app is also designed to handle errors that may be encountered in the calls to API, and the web layout is very responsive to different screen sizes.

You are welcome to leave notes for optimizations for me!
